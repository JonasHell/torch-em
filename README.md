# Torch'em

Deep-learning based semantic and instance segmentation for 3D Electron Microscopy and other bioimage analysis problems based on pytorch.
Any feedback is highly appreciated, just open an issue!

Highlights:
- Functional API with sensible defaults to train a state-of-the-art segmentation model with a few lines of code.
- Differentiable augmentations on GPU and CPU thanks to [kornia](https://github.com/kornia/kornia).
- Off-the-shelf logging with [tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) or [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site).
- Export trained models to [bioimage.io](https://bioimage.io/#/) model format with one function call to deploy them in [ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/nn/nn) or [deepimageJ](https://deepimagej.github.io/deepimagej/).

Design:
- All parameters are specified in code, no configuration files.
- No callback logic; to extend the core functionality inherit from `trainer.DefaultTrainer` instead.
- All data-loading is lazy to support training on large data-sets.

```python
# train a 2d U-Net for foreground and boundary segmentation of nuclei
# using data from https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist/releases/download/0.1.0/dsb2018.zip

import torch
import torch_em
from torch_em.model import UNet2d
from torch_em.data.datasets import get_dsb_loader

model = UNet2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=2)

# transform to go from instance segmentation labels
# to foreground/background and boundary channel
label_transform = torch_em.transform.BoundaryTransform(
    add_binary_target=True, ndim=2
)

# training and validation data loader
data_path = "./dsb"  # the training data will be downloaded and saved here
train_loader = get_dsb_loader(
    data_path, 
    patch_shape=(1, 256, 256),
    batch_size=8
    split="train",
    download=True,
    label_transform=label_transform
)
val_loader = get_dsb_loader(
    data_path, 
    patch_shape=(1, 256, 256),
    batch_size=8,
    split="test",
    label_transform=label_transform
)

# the trainer object that handles the training details
# the model checkpoints will be saved in "checkpoints/dsb-boundary-model"
# the tensorboard logs will be saved in "logs/dsb-boundary-model"
trainer = torch_em.default_segmentation_trainer(
    name="dsb-boundary-model",
    model=model,
    train_loader=train_loader,
    val_loader=val_loader,
    learning_rate=1e-4,
    device=torch.device("cuda")
)
trainer.fit(iterations=5000)

# export bioimage.io model format
from glob import glob
import imageio
from torch_em.util import export_bioimageio_model

# load one of the images to use as reference image image
# and crop it to a shape that is guaranteed to fit the network
test_im = imageio.imread(glob(f"{data_path}/test/images/*.tif")[0])[:256, :256]

export_bioimageio_model("./checkpoints/dsb-boundary-model", "./bioimageio-model", test_im)
```

## Installation

### From conda

You can install `torch_em` from conda-forge:
```
conda install -c conda-forge torch_em
```
Please check out [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/) for more information on how to install a pytorch version compatible with your system.

### From source

It's recommmended to set up a conda environment for using `torch_em`.
Two conda environment files are provided: `environment_cpu.yaml` for a pure cpu set-up and `environment_gpu.yaml` for a gpu set-up.
If you want to use the gpu version, make sure to set the correct cuda version for your system in the environment file, by modifiying [this-line](https://github.com/constantinpape/torch-em/blob/main/environment_gpu.yaml#L9).

You can set up a conda environment using one of these files like this:
```sh
conda env create -f <ENV>.yaml -n <ENV_NAME>
conda activate <ENV_NAME>
pip install -e .
```
where <ENV>.yaml is either `environment_cpu.yaml` or `environment_gpu.yaml`.


## Features
